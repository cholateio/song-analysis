# session-start.sh — SessionStart hook (kit self-onboarding)
#
# Two jobs, both cheap:
#   1. Inject dynamic kit context into the session: active KIT_PROFILE,
#      reviewer availability, kit version, and this session's
#      review-marker paths. Claude cannot know its own session_id any other
#      way — the /kit-review and /kit-skip-review skills rely on this
#      broadcast to write their evidence lines to the right marker files.
#   2. Record the review-gate baseline that verify-final-review.sh checks:
#      line1 = HEAD at session start (closes the "committed changes are
#      invisible to git status" blind spot), line2 = a content hash of the
#      working tree (so pre-existing dirt and already-certified states
#      don't re-trigger the gate).
#
# Output: JSON with hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext (exit 0).
# Failures must never break session start — every path falls through to exit 0.
#
# Reference: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks#sessionstart

RE-ANCHOR (context was just ${SOURCE}ed — memory of this session is lossy now). BEFORE the next file modification:
1. Re-read CLAUDE.md 'Project-specific constraints' (the no-touch zones).
2. Re-read the active plan / progress doc if one exists (docs/plans/, docs/specs/, .superpowers/).
3. State in ONE sentence which phase you are in and which files are already DONE — completed work is off-limits unless the plan says otherwise.
Do not rely on your summarized memory for any of the above — re-read the files."
